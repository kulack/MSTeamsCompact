# MSTeamsCompact
Microsoft Teams Compact Userscript

Just a few small tweaks to the UI to compact some elements, and to reduce margins.

#### Features
- Removed left and right padding from chat messages
- Reduced padding from team view messages
- Shrinking default fonts
- Reduced font size, line heights, and padding in Github Enterprise notifications
- Shrink application and teams navigation bars on the left

#### Install
This user script is for a web version of teams. 

There's a browser extension called Tampermonkey that you use with it [https://www.tampermonkey.net/](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). Install Tamper Monkey, click on the install link on this page auto installs the script. 
Tampermonkey then lets you also edit it manually in the browser, auto-update it when it changes in github and lots of other stuff.

Have fun!
